# Operation UsefulAF

Welcome to **Operation UsefulAF**. The project that wasn’t supposed to exist but now does because I couldn’t mind my business.  

---

## 🤡 What is this?
Honestly I don’t even know. Some mix of:
- Tools I built instead of touching grass  
- Features nobody asked for but are now canon  
- Code that started as a “what if” and ended up ruining my weekend  

---

## Why the name?
Because “Operation Kinda-Helpful” didn’t slap.  
Everything here somehow ends up being **Useful AF**, against all odds.  

---

## Mission Statement
- Step 1: Build random shit  
- Step 2: Accidentally make useful shit 
- Step 3: Get my shit together
- Step 3: Pretend the shit was the plan all along

## Status
Still cooking. Might ship. Might not.
